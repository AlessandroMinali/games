DURAK

Material:
52-card deck, remove the jokers
Players:
2-6

Setup:
Each player is dealt six cards.
The rest of the cards form the main deck.
Draw the top card, place it face up and under the deck at a right-angle so it remains visible.
The face up card's suit is the "trump". Cards with that suit beat all other cards.

Scoring:
Card rank is in ascending order with ace at the top and trumps beating all.

Play:
Player with lowest trump card starts(they do not have to play it)
Play goes clockwise, with the current player attacking the player to their left.
The attacker may put any card(or multiple cards with same rank) from their hand face up infront of the defender.
The defender may use cards from their hand to match the suit with a higher rank of the attacking card to sucessfully defend, or a trump may be used at any time. (ie. attack of 7 spade can be defended with 10 spade or trump)
The defender may choose to forfeit at any time and must pick up all cards that were used in the attack/defense, they lose their turn to attack this round.
Other players may join the attack on the defender if they have cards with the same rank. Up to six attacks may be conducted on a defender.
If the defender succesfully defends all attacks put forward, all cards played are put into the discard pile. Each player nows draws cards in the order they attacked until everyone has six cards again. Play now starts with the old defender becoming the attacker.
If the deck runs out the final card drawn is the original trump. Play continues until the first player has no more cards and is declared the winner.
