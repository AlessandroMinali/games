DENYING
Any player may block the current player from taking their action if they claim to have the proper card. If so, the player is prevented from taking the action but they may CONFRONT their opposition. If the CONFRONTATION is successful, the current player completes their original action and the confronting player must SACRIFICE.

CONFRONTATION
Any player may CONFRONT the current player when they take an action if they think they are bluffing. The current player must prove they have the card or else lose the CONFRONTATION.
If the current player has correct card they show the card, place it back into the deck, shuffle, draw a new card. The opposing played has lost the CONFRONTATION and must SACRIFICE. Otherwise the current player must SACRIFICE.

SACRIFICE
Turn one of your cards face up and place in the discard pile, it is no longer in play. If that is your final card you are eliminated.
