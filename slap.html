EGYPTIAN RAT SLAP

Material:
52-card deck, remove the jokers
Players:
2-6

Setup:
Deal the entire deck out amongst the players. You may remove cards to ensure everyone has the same starting numbers of cards. No player is allowed to look at their stack of cards and it must be kept face down at all times.

Play:
Player to dealers left goes first.

Players take turns drawing the top card from their deck outwards toward the centre and placing it face up.
As cards begin to pile up in the centre players must be ready to slap their hand down on the pile if they see one of the following patterns occur:
Double:   most recently played card is the same rank as the last played card.
Sandwich: most recently played card is the same rank as the 3rd last played card.
Run:      most recently played card follows the last two played cards rank in ascending/descending order.

Whichever player slaps their hand down first when a pattern appears wins the round and collects all the cards in the pile to be placed at the bottom of their hand face down.

If you slap an incorrect pattern you must sacrifice your next card immediately and place it at the bottom of the face up pile. This card does not contribute to patterns. Play then continues where it left off.

The face cards(J, Q, K) and the ace have special powers to be followed when the are played. When played the next player must play cards, equal to the special rule, in succession. If no pattern appears or another special card, then the player who played the last special card wins the pile. Special cards can interrupt each other.
Jack: play 1 card 
Queen: play 2 cards
King: play 3 cards
Ace: play 4 cards
At anytime if a pattern appears it supersedes all other rules.

When you run out of cards you are out. You may still slap back in on a pattern but if you make an bad slap then you are permanently out. The last player with cards wins.
