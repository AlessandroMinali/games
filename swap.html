SWAP/CAMBIO

Material:
52-card deck
Players:
2-6

Setup:
Deal the entire deck out amongst the players. You may remove cards to ensure everyone has the same starting numbers of cards. No player is allowed to look at their stack of cards and it must be kept face down at all times.

Special Cards:
6     swap entire hands of any two players
7/8   select one of your own cards to look at
9/10  select one of your opponents cards to look at
J     swap any two cards(keeping them face down)
Q     look at any one card and/or swap any two cards(keeping them face down)
- - - - - -
Red K =  0
Joker = -2
Ace   =  1
Other = rank

Play:
Each player is dealt 4 cards face down, aligned with two besides each other and the other two beside and above.
The rest of the deck is placed face down in the centre and the top card drawn and revealed beside it face up.
Each player then has a chance to peek at their bottom two cards then place them face down again.
No player may look at any card unless a rule allows them to.
Starting with the player to the left of the dealer, players take turns either drawing from deck or swapping the last card in the face up pile with one of their face down cards. When a card is drawn from the deck it may be swapped with one of your face down cards(your face down card is thus played into the centre pile face up and replaced with the drawn card) or the drawn card may be placed into the pile to activate it's special power(see above).
At any point you may play any face down card(yours or others) onto the main pile if you think it matches the rank. If correctly match then the card stays there. If incorrectly matches you must take back your card and the cards of equal rank at the top of the pile and draw one more penalty card to your side of the table(keeping it hidden).
The goal is get the lowest score per round. Usually play consists of several accumulative rounds where a winner is declared after say 4 rounds added together.
