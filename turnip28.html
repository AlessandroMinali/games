SEQUENCE OF PLAY
1. 'Make Ready' one of your Snobs who hasn't acted this round.
2. Choose a friendly Follower in range to order. May choose to self-order the Snob. Cannot order other Snobs.
3. Declare Order for unit.
4. Check if unit Blunders.
5. Execute Order.
6. Opponent's turn.
If one player runs out of Snobs, the other player keeps acting until all their Snobs have been Made Ready.
Once all Snobs have gone, remaining Followers act via steps 3-6, but now may suffer Scenario Blunders.

1" RULE
1. Followers must end movement/deployment 1" away from friendly Followers. Snobs can come in closer.
2. Any unit retreating may cross within 1" or through any another unit while moving.
3. Any unit charging may cross within 1" of an enemy unit. Can end within 1" of the charge target only.

COMBAT
TARGETING: Must target closest enemy within line of sight(LoS). All units have 360deg field of view.
MODIFIERS: Are cumulative but can never reduce below 2+(ie. a roll of 1 always fails).
IMPROBABLE HIT(ie. 7+): Roll an unmodified 6 then roll again unmodified 4+ to hit.
LINE OF SIGHT(LoS): Blocked by all Followers/Snobs/Terrain if it obscures almost all of a model. Min of one model needs LoS.
RANGE: Any part of target model must be within the specified value. Min of one model needs to be in range.

MISHAPS
BLUNDER TEST: d6, on a 1 then unit receives a panic token and a blunder penalty. Snobs can never blunder.
SCENARIO BLUNDER: Instead of normal blunder, refer to the scenario for what happens.
PANIC TEST: d6 + panic tokens on unit, if 1-6: pass; else: failed. Note: a unit may never have more than 6 panic.
DANGEROUS TERRAIN TEST: d6 per model and remove models for every 1 rolled. Gain 1 panic if any casualties suffered.

TERRAIN
Cover(6"x1"): If target has half their models behind and within 3" of cover then +1 Inaccuracy to enemy shooters.
Defensible(6"x6"): Target within is Fearless against shooting, if wholly within then also +1 Inaccuracy to enemy shooters.
Dangerous(9"x9"): Causes a Dangerous Terrain Test when actively moved through or deployed within.
Impassable(6"x6"): On contact, unit must remove models equal to units panic tokens. Includes board edge.

GAME
INITIATIVE: Each player rolls d6 until one rolls higher, they go first.
REGIMENT: 1 Toff + 2 Followers, 2 Toadies with 1 Follower each. Equip all units.
DEPLOYMENT: Snob + attached Followers within deployment area alternating between players.
ROUND: Once all units have performed an order or been Made Ready.
OBJECTIVES: Once an order, Follower ends any movement within 1", objective is captured. If contested, becomes uncaptured.
GAME: 4 rounds.
