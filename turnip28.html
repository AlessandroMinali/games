1. 'Make Ready' a Toff/Snob who hasn't acted this round.
2. Choose unit in range to order. Cannot Order other Snobs.
3. Declare Order for unit.
4. Check for Blunder.
5. Execute Order.
Keep alternating turns. If one player runs out of Snobs the other player may keep acting until all their Snobs have been Made Ready.
Once all Snobs have gone then each follower who hasn't be given an order repeats 3-4, but now may suffer Scenario Blunders.

1. Determine furthest model from the enemy and move that model directly away from the enemy no less than d6 + 2" per panic token.
2. Keep moving backwards if you cannot find a space which obeys the 1" RULE.
3. Make a Dangerous Terrain Test each time you cross over any Follower or move through Dangerous Terrain.

TARGETING: Must target closest enemy within line of sight(LoS). All units have 360deg field of view.
IMPROBABLE HIT(ie. 7+): Roll an unmodified 6 then roll again unmodified 4+ to hit.
LINE OF SIGHT(LoS): Blocked by all units(except Snobs) and terrain if it obscures almost all of a model. If one model has LoS, then the entire unit does as well.
RANGE: Any part of target model must be within the specified value. If one model is in range, then the entire unit is as well.

1" RULE
1. Must end all movement 1" away from friendly units unless friendly Snob or charging target enemy.
2. Must never cross within 1" of enemy unless charging or retreating.
3. May only cross through other units while retreating.

BLUNDER TEST: d6, on a 1 then unit receives a panic token and follow blunder penalty. Snobs can never blunder.
SCENARIO BLUNDER: Instead of normal blunder, refer to the scenario for what happens.
PANIC TEST: d6 + panic tokens on unit, if greater than 6 then the unit retreats.

DANGEROUS TERRAIN TEST
1. roll d6 per model in the unit
2. Unit must remove models equal to the 1s rolled.
3. Unit gains 1 panic token if any models were removed.

TERRAIN
Cover(6"x1"): If target has half their models behind and within 3" of cover then +1 Inaccuracy to shooter. 
Defensible(6"x6"): If within then target is Fearless, if wholly within then also +1 Inaccuracy to shooter.
Impassable(6"x6"): On contact, unit must remove models equal to units panic tokens. Includes board edge.
Dangerous(9"x9"): Causes a Dangerous Terrain Test when actively moved through.

INITIATIVE: Each player rolls d6 until one rolls higher, they go first.
REGIMENT: 1 Toff + 2 Followers, 2 Snobs with 1 Follower each. Equip all units.
DEPLOYMENT: Snob + attached Followers within deployment area alternating between players.
ROUND: Once all units have performed an order or been Made Ready.
GAME: 4 rounds.
