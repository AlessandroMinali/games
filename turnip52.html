T52 <small>a standalone conversion of <a href="https://www.patreon.com/Turnip28">T28</a> to be played with a deck of cards by <a href="https://github.com/AlessandroMinali">Alessandro Minali</a></small>

MATERIALS
Requires at least a 2'x2' area, a standard 52 deck of cards, a d6, paper+pencil or phone to track various stats. Ideally each player has their own d6 and stat tracking accessory. If played with more players then the decks of cards needed is as follows: total players divided by 2 and rounded up.

UNIT STATS
     Movement(M) maximum distance the unit may move per round if ordered.
       Attack(A) number of attacks per soldier if in a melee.
   Inaccuracy(I) skill at shooting, need to roll above to hit so lower values are better.
Vulnerability(V) skill at avoiding fatal wounds, need to roll above to dodge so lower values are better.
       Wounds(W) hits a soldier may take before succumbing(being removed from play), higher is better.
        Range(R) distance they can shoot with ranged weapons.

BUILDING YOUR REGIMENT
Players control many units organized into a regiment. Each unit may be comprised of one or more soldiers.
Each player has 1 Joker which is the Toff and 2 Aces which are Snobs. These units have only 1 soldier. They are the commanders, snivelling and aristocratic. Their attack range is also their effective ordering range.

They are equipped with weapons that allow for melee and ranged attacks, though they receive no bonus and may fire many times per round. A Toff may recruit 2 Follower units and each Snob may recruit 1. Snobs may not recruit further Snobs. A typical game then has a player's regiment being: 1 Toff + 2 units, 2 Snobs and 2 further units(1 per snob respectively). <b>A Toff is considered a Snob for the purposes of all further ruling, but it has a unique stat block.</b>

Toff
M(3") A(3) I(5) V(5) W(2) R(3")
Snob
M(3") A(1) I(5) V(5) W(1) R(3")

Follower units are picked from any numbered cards that are even, from 4 to 10. Each Follower has as many soldiers, Inaccuracy and Vulnerability equal to the number value of their card. The maximum Inaccuracy/Vulnerability is 6. <b>Each number card may be picked only twice by each player.</b>

Each Follower must be paired with an odd coloured number card representing its equipment, determined by the cards suit.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Red</span>: melee weapons which give -1 to Inaccuracy.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Black</span>: black powder weapons(ranged) which may be only fired once per round.

The card representing equipment may be stacked underneath the unit card so it's suit is visible. The equipment card does not affect the units size for measuring purposes. In addition to the above equipment, value 4 cards may be also equipped with a Queen to be considered a unit of cavalry.

Follower
M(3") A(1) I(4-6) V(4-6) W(1) R(9")
Cavalry Follower
M(6") A(2) I(4) V(4) W(2) R(9")
Artillery Follower
M(--) A(3) I(6) V(5) W(3) R(-)

The final unit is the Artillery Follower, represented by the 3 card. This unit has 1 soldier and may never move under any circumstance. It is always assumed to be equipped with black powder weapons. For any 1 rolled by this unit immediately roll another dice and if it confirms with another 1, then this unit is immediately destroyed. Here are the two type of attacks it can make:
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Lump Shot(Range Limitless)</span>:
Roll three dice for your shooting attack. Each hit deals 2 Wound and cannot be avoided with a Vulnerability roll.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Canister Shot(Range 6")</span>:
Roll 3d6. This is the number of shooting attack you may make. All other rules follow as normal.

UPGRADES
To further customize your Followers each player has 4 upgrades points to spend. Each upgrade costs 1 point if used on a value 4 unit or 2 points otherwise. Snobs may never be upgraded. There are no further restrictions to stack and combine upgrades. Upgrades must be tracked and shared so each player is aware of them during play(ie. write it down on paper/phone).
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Mean</span>: Increase Attack by 1.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Tough</span>: Increase Wound by 1.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Marksman</span>: Decrease Inaccuracy by 1.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Agile</span>: Decrease Vulnerability by 1.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Mob</span>: If unit has more than 6 soldiers then it is Fearless.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Fearless</span>: If about to fail a Panic Test, make unmodified 3+ roll to force unit to not retreat and pass their Panic Test.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sharpshooter</span>: When shooting/charging, may target any enemy.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Vanguard</span>: May move once before game starts(starting with player that has Initiative). Snobs may not follow.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Skirmisher</span>: Attackers shooting this unit receive +2 Inaccuracy.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Dash</span>: May move up to Movement after completing an order. Snobs may not follow.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Bowel-loosening Charge</span>: Charge targets must re-roll successful Panic Tests once.

TERRAIN
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Dangerous Terrain</span>: Two cards face down intersecting each other in any way. Any time a unit moves across it must make a Dangerous Terrain Test.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Cover</span>: One face down card. Any unit may move into cover by occupying half of the cover card. When in cover a unit gains -1 Vulnerability if cover is between the unit and an enemy firing. Only one unit may occupy cover at a time. Cover may be moved over with no penalty.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Defensible Terrain</span>: Two faced down cards side-by-side. One unit may occupy this terrain at a time. If an enemy fires at a unit wholly within defensible terrain the enemy gains +1 Inaccuracy and the defending unit gains Fearless.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Impassable Terrain</span>: Edge of the board. On contact, the entire unit is obliterated and removed from play.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Objective Marker</span>: Represented by a face up King, additionally the centre objective is represented with a face up Jack. Objectives can be captured by a player after having a unit other than a Toff/Snob end their move within 1" of the marker. Moving away from a previously captured objective has no effect, it remains captured. If two opposing units are present the objective is uncaptured until one opposing side is further than 1", which then immediately captures the objective for the remaining unit with out needing to end a move near it.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Game Length</span>: 4 rounds
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Victory</span>: Whoever holds the most objectives
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sudden Death</span>: Losing you Toff and all Snobs means automatic defeat.

MECHANICS
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Measuring</span>:
You may use any left over cards as a measuring tool. Treat the long side of a standard playing card as 3" and the top as 2". Therefore half of the top of a card can be used to measure 1"!
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1" Rule</span>:
1. Must end all movement 1" away from friendly units unless friendly Snob or charging target enemy.
2. Must never cross within 1" of enemy unless charging or retreating.
3. May only cross through other units while retreating.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Targeting</span>:
Must target closest enemy within line of sight(LoS). All units have 360deg field of view.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Improbable Hits(ie. 7+)</span>:
Roll an unmodified 6 then roll again unmodified 4+ to hit.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Line of Sight(LoS)</span>:
Blocked by all units(except Snobs) and terrain if it obscures almost all of a unit. If one part of a unit has LoS, then the entire unit does as well.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Range</span>:
Any part of target unit must be within the specified value. If one part of the unit is in range, then the entire unit is as well.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Panic Test</span>:
Roll d6 + soldiers missing from unit. If greater than 6 unit retreats.
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Dangerous Terrain Test</span>:
Roll a d6 per soldier left in the unit. Unit must remove soldiers equal to the 1s rolled.

SETUP
Find a suitable area and each player may build their army as they see fit following the terms above. Make each other aware of unit upgrades(write them down somewhere that anyone may access at anytime during play).

Each roll a d6, the player with a higher value has Initiative. Ties are broken by re-rolling until there is a winner. Player with Initiative selects a side of the play field and the other is given the opposite. Deployment zones is up to 4" from a player's respective board edge. The player with Initiative always acts first for each step of setup and each game round.

A typical terrain setup is as follows:
Players alternate placing 1 dangerous terrain within their deployment zone. Repeat with placing 1 cover. Finally place 1 defensible terrain along the centre line.
Place the centre objective(Jack). Now players alternate placing 4 objective markers onto the table.
<b>All pieces of terrain must be at least 4" away from similar terrain and the edge of the play area.</b>
Now each player may deploy their army within their deployment zone and begin the game.
